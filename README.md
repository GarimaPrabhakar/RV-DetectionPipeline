# RV-DetectionPipeline
A simple and fast detection pipeline following Zechmeister et al (2009). This pipeline utilizes Radvel, an RV fitting software, from Fulton et al. (2018)

Feel free to look around. This repo is still under construction to make it more robust (and clean up some code). Please let me know if you spot any bugs!

## Dependencies

This pipeline uses the following software:
- Python 3 (or higher)
- Numpy
- Astropy
- Scipy
- statsmodels
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Radvel*
- os
- random 
- time

*I used the Radvel radial velocity fitting software, courtesy of Fulton et al. (2018)

You should have a lot of these libraries in your system. However, if you don't, they can be installed with pip as follows:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install astropy
pip install scipy
pip install statsmodels
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install radvel
pip nstall os
pip install random
pip install time
```
