# RV-DetectionPipeline
A simple and fast detection pipeline following Zechmeister et al (2009). This pipeline utilizes Radvel, an RV fitting software, from Fulton et al. (2018)

Feel free to look around. This repo is still under construction to make it more robust (and clean up some code). Please let me know if you spot any bugs!
